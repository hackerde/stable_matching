# Stable Matching Algorithm

This program demonstrates the stable matching algorithm using couples and marriages.

There are 3 boys and 3 girls.
The boys propose, the girls decide.
Everything is pretty much fixed in the program.
You can modify the order of preferencese easily.

The output shows every iteration of the algorithms and how the matching happens.

Be sure to run this with Python 2.7:

`$ python StableMarriageAlgo.py`
